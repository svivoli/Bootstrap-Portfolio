### Description

The purpose of this project was to take the portfolio that I created for homework 1 and make it more responsive, utilizing tools from bootstrap. In doing so I was able to give my portfolio page a smoother interface across multiple platforms, making it more mobile friendly.

Added Bootstrap Components:
1. Navbar
    (Hamburger toggler)
    (Dropdown link menu to other pages)
2. Grid System
    (Containers, rows, columns)
3. Responsive Images
4. A-Tagged Name in Header
    (Links to home page from every page)
5. Media Queries
    (for xs, sm, md, lg screens)

### My Experience

Difficulties
* CSS styling had to be tinkered with when bootstrap was introduced
* Differences in CSS across the different media queries, not always perfect crossovers
* Styling the hamburger toggler and the header for tablets and phones
* Making sure I had all the proper tags in place to ensure my code would work! (meta tags, script tags, etc.)
* Page would look one way in devtools when but another way when testing on my phone

Overall, this project was much more difficult than the first. At first, my media queries would not work at all, until I went to Sky and he pointed out that I needed the proper meta tag in place to make them function (thanks, Sky).  I am pleased with how the hamburger toggler/dropdown menu turned out, as those are a common and interactive mobile tool. This seemed like a very relevant project in today's world, since so much user browsing takes place on phones and tablets. Having a sleek and functional design both on a desktop and on smaller devices is absolutely critical. Looking forward to the next challenge!
