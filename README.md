# Portfolio + Bootstrap

### Description

The purpose of this project was to take the portfolio that I created for homework 1 and make it more responsive, utilizing tools from bootstrap. In doing so I was able to give my portfolio page a smoother interface across multiple platforms, making it more mobile friendly.

Added Bootstrap Components:
1. Navbar
    (Hamburger toggler)
    (Dropdown link menu to other pages)
2. Grid System
    (Containers, rows, columns)
3. Responsive Images
4. A-Tagged Name in Header
    (Links to home page from every page)
5. Media Queries
    (for xs, sm, md, lg screens)

### My Experience

Difficulties
* CSS styling had to be tinkered with when bootstrap was introduced
* Differences in CSS across the different media queries, not always perfect crossovers
* Styling the hamburger toggler and the header for tablets and phones
* Making sure I had all the proper tags in place to ensure my code would work! (meta tags, script tags, etc.)

Overall, this project was much more difficult than the first. At first, my media queries would not work at all, and I was getting very frustrated, until I went to Sky and he pointed out that I needed the proper meta tag in place to make them function. (Thanks, Sky). I also realised far into the project that I had not used the bootstrap jumbotron, and although I would have liked to experiment with that I decided I didn't want to sacrifice my work to add it when I was so close to finishing. I'll have to play around with that now that I'm finished and make a second version of the project. I am pleased with how the hamburger toggler/dropdown menu turned out, as those are a common and interactive mobile tool. Looking forward to the next challenge!
