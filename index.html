                                    My name is Sarah Vivoli (you won't pronounce it right, but only two people ever have
                                    so it's okay). As of April 2020, I will have graduated from the University of Oregon
                                    with a Bachelor's of Science degree with a major in Economics and a minor in
                                    Philosophy and a coding for web development certification. I have worked in Real
                                    Estate and Wealth Management, and briefly considered and even prepared to apply to
                                    law school, but am ready to turn my professional experience toward the world of
                                    software engineering. I come from a large family of electrical engineers who have
                                    all pursued programming so I guess I am facing an inevitable but exciting fate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I developed an interest in coding when I was 12 or 13 years old, when I taught
                                    myself the basics of html so I could personalize my MySpace page without being
                                    constrained by the premade layouts. My interest really took off in college in the
                                    midst of my economics degree. We used various software applications to write code
                                    for economic purposes (run regressions, forecast, create models, etc.), and I was
                                    reminded of my love for writing tedious logic-based code and coming close to
                                    throwing my computer at the wall all because of one missing character. I decided to
                                    take an intro to CIS class to get my feet wet and see if it really was something I
                                    could see myself pursuing. Sure enough, after the quarter was over I knew I had
                                    found what I wanted to do post grad.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was grateful to hear about the Boot Camp program from a friend while I was
                                    considering getting a degree in CIS after finishing up my first degree, because the
                                    program would save a lot of time yet be arguably more intensive and challenging. So
                                    here I am, ready to dive into the meticulous world of coding as a career, and embark
                                    on an everlasting journey of learning and skill development.
                                </p>
