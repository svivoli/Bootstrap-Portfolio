                        My name is Sarah Vivoli (you won't pronounce it right, but only two people ever have so it's okay).  As of April 2020, I will have graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's of Science degree with a major in Economics and a minor in Philosophy and a coding for web development certification.  I have worked in Real Estate and Wealth Management, and briefly considered and even prepared to apply to law school, but am ready to turn my professional experience toward the world of software engineering.  I come from a large family of electrical engineers who have all pursued programming so I guess I am facing an inevitable but exciting fate.

                    <p>
                        I developed an interest in coding when I was 12 or 13 years old, when I taught myself the basics of html so I could personalize my MySpace page without being constrained by the premade layouts.  My interest really took off in college in the midst of my economics degree.  We used various software applications to write code for economic purposes (run regressions, forecast, create models, etc.), and I was reminded of my love for writing tedious logic-based code and coming close to throwing my computer at the wall all because of one missing character.  I decided to take an intro to CIS class to get my feet wet and see if it really was something I could see myself pursuing.  Sure enough, after the quarter was over I knew I had found what I wanted to do post grad.

                        I was grateful to hear about the Boot Camp program from a friend while I was considering getting a degree in CIS after finishing up my first degree, because the program would save a lot of time yet be arguably more intensive and challenging.  So here I am, ready to dive into the meticulous world of coding as a career, and embark on an everlasting journey of learning and skill development.
